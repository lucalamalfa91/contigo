# Task E01/F02/US01/T01 (ADR-007: two thin environment roots instantiate
# the shared module library; this one is "demo"). See infra/versions.tf
# and infra/provider.tf for why the terraform{}/provider{} blocks below
# are duplicated here rather than shared -- Terraform has no
# cross-directory include, so each root carries its own copy in
# lockstep.
#
# Task E01/F02/US03/T01 (us-03-demo-environment): this root is the demo
# instantiation of that library. Every module below is called with its
# ADR-005 default SKU (see the per-module comment above each block) --
# no override is needed here because those defaults already satisfy
# ADR-005 for both environments. Isolation from `dev` (ADR-016: dev and
# demo must never share a Postgres/Storage/Service Bus, and promotion
# moves code only, never data) is structural, not configured:
# `locals.environment = "demo"` feeds every module's naming/tagging, so
# every resource name (rg-contigo-demo, psql-contigo-demo,
# sbns-contigo-demo, ...) and the remote state backend
# (backend.tf -> HCP workspace "contigo-demo", ADR-007) are distinct
# from the "dev" root's by construction -- there is no shared store id
# to assert against. See scripts/terraform_env_roots_scan.py for the
# automated structural proof and task E01/F02/US03/T02 for the
# dedicated cross-environment isolation check.
