# Task E01/F02/US04/T02 (keyvault-scope-grants) and task E01/F02/US05/T01
# (foundry-account-provision) both need the ARM resource id of the SAME
# workload identity `workload_principal_id` (above) identifies by
# principal/object id. `azurerm_role_assignment.principal_id` (modules/
# keyvault) and `azurerm_container_app.identity[0].identity_ids` (modules/
# containerapps) take two different shapes of identifier for one
# underlying identity -- a role assignment's principal_id is the AAD
# object id, while attaching a user-assigned identity to a resource, or
# recording the ADR-008 Foundry/Document Intelligence connection's RBAC
# grant (ADR-011), needs its full ARM resource id. Task E01/F02/US05/T02
# (foundry-connection-verify) records this same value against each
# per-project Foundry connection id (scripts/foundry_connection_verify.py)
# -- one workload identity per environment, never a literal, in any of
# its three consumers.

# collision between task E01/F02/US04/T02 and task E01/F02/US05/T01,
# which independently added the same-named output on sibling branches cut
# from the same parent commit. That state failed `terraform fmt
# -recursive -check` (Unclosed configuration block) and `terraform
# validate` (Missing required argument "value"; Unsupported block type)
# for both environments. Collapsed back to the single block Terraform
# requires; the value and consumers are unchanged.
