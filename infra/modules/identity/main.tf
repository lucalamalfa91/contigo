# modules/identity -- Entra app registrations + user-assigned managed
# identity (ADR-007 module layout). The managed identity is what
# containerapps' API/worker apps use to read Key Vault, Storage, and
# Service Bus at runtime without a stored secret (ADR-007: no secrets in
# Terraform source).
#
# Task E01/F02/US04/T01 (ADR-010) adds the second of the two
# per-environment app registrations -- a PKCE-only public client, pre-
# authorized for the API's Contigo.Read/Contigo.Write scopes -- so each
# environment carries its own isolated pair (api + public client; four
# registrations total across dev+demo). Neither application ever declares
# a `password {}` block: the public client authenticates with
# Authorization Code + PKCE (web SPA and native mobile), and the API
# validates tokens by signature/issuer/audience only (ADR-010; ADR-011 "no
# secrets in ... Terraform source").
