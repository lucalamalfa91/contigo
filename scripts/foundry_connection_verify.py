"""Structural verification for Foundry connection readiness (task
E01/F02/US05/T02, foundry-connection-verify).

Parent story `us-05-foundry-account` AC-1..AC-4 (one hub; two projects
`contigo-dev`/`contigo-demo`; one pay-as-you-go AI services account;
per-project Document Intelligence connection). Task E01/F02/US05/T01
(already merged into this branch) recorded that shape as
FOUNDRY_HUB_NAME/AI_SERVICES_ACCOUNT_NAME/FOUNDRY_PROJECTS in
scripts/bootstrap_hcp_org.py and structurally asserted it is complete and
internally consistent (check_foundry_account_recorded). This task's own
coding objective ("Verify Foundry hub/projects availability in
westeurope; record connection ids") is narrower and additive -- never a
re-decision of what T01 already owns:

  1. Region -- ADR-006 pins both `dev` and `demo` to the same region
     ("West Europe" / `westeurope`), and ADR-008's own Assumptions section
     names that as the region Foundry + Document Intelligence must be
     available in. check_region_pinned_to_westeurope() re-asserts (not
     just assumes) that both environment roots are still pinned there --
     via scripts/terraform_env_roots_scan.check_location_pin(), the same
     check task E01/F02/US01/T02 already wrote -- and that the canonical
     Foundry region slug this task records (`westeurope`) is the same
     region. One region, one source of truth (infra/environments/*/
     variables.tf), never a second literal that could silently drift.
  2. Connection ids -- T01 recorded a Document Intelligence connection
     *name* per project (e.g. `conn-docint-contigo-dev`) but never a
     structured connection *id* tying hub/account/project/connection name
     together. build_foundry_connections() derives one deterministically
     from T01's own recorded constants (never a second, hand-typed copy),
     and the check_connection_* functions below prove each is
     well-formed, unique per project/environment, and still resolves to
     the single ADR-008 AI services account -- no second account, no
     cross-environment collision.
  3. Identity material -- ADR-008: "The AI Gateway reads Foundry endpoint
     + credentials via managed identity/Key Vault; no model key in
     Terraform source or app code." The managed identity that later
     authenticates each connection above is
     infra/modules/identity/outputs.tf's `workload_identity_id` output
     (tasks E01/F02/US04/T02 and E01/F02/US05/T01).
     check_workload_identity_output_well_formed() proves that output
     exists exactly once and resolves to the real resource attribute.
     This is deliberately stricter than the sibling scans: both
     keyvault_scope_grants_check.py and entra_keyvault_provision_scan.py
     collect outputs into a {name: value} dict, so a *duplicate* block
     name is invisible to a plain membership check (the last match wins
     silently). This script counts block *headers* via regex first, so a
     repeat of the exact drift this task found on this branch --
     modules/identity/outputs.tf briefly held two textually-overlapping
     `output "workload_identity_id"` blocks after a phase-barrier merge
     between this task and E01/F02/US04/T02 -- fails loudly instead of
     passing by accident.

Like every other Foundry/HCP check in this repo, none of this is a live
Azure or HCP Terraform API call: Azure AI Foundry hub/project/connection
creation is an interactive Azure Portal step (ADR-008), and this harness
has no Azure subscription credential in scope. "Availability" here means
what scripts/bootstrap_hcp_org.py's own Foundry section already means --
the recorded shape is complete, internally consistent, and pinned to the
same region as the rest of the infrastructure -- not a live capacity
check against Azure.

Checks, all read-only, no network, no `terraform` binary, no Azure/HCP
credentials required.

Usage:
    python scripts/foundry_connection_verify.py

Exit 0 if every check passes. Non-zero otherwise, with a PASS/FAIL line
per check on stdout (failures also echoed to stderr).
