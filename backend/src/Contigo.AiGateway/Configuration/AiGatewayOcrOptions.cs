/// truncated" — <see cref="MaxPagesPerDocument"/> is that budget.

/// Enforced once, inside <see cref="IAiGateway.OcrAsync"/> itself (today:
/// <see cref="Fixtures.FixtureAiGateway"/>), the same "single choke point" reasoning
/// <see cref="AiGatewayComplianceOptions"/>'s own doc comment already uses for no-training — every
/// current and future caller (today: the Documents/Contracts hybrid pre-pass) is protected without
/// having to remember to check a budget itself, and a caller can never work around the cap by
/// calling <see cref="IAiGateway.OcrAsync"/> with a hand-sliced subset of pages instead (that would
/// silently re-introduce the "2-page cap" ADR-017 forbids) — over budget means the whole call
/// fails, in full.
