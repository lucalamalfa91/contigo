/// <summary>
/// AI Gateway interface consumed by domain modules (Documents/Contracts, Chat). Domain modules
/// depend on this abstraction; the implementation behind it is the only place that touches
/// Foundry / Document Intelligence SDKs (module-map "AI Gateway" row;
/// us-01-ai-gateway-classification AC-3). ADR-004: each role is bound to a
/// configuration-selected model id — see
/// <see cref="Contigo.AiGateway.Configuration.AiGatewayModelOptions"/> — so a model swap is a
/// config change, never a code change.
///
/// Task E02/F01/US01/T01 implemented four of ADR-004's five roles: <see cref="ClassifyAsync"/>,
/// <see cref="ExtractAsync"/>, <see cref="EmbedAsync"/>, <see cref="AnswerAsync"/> — exactly the
/// set named by that task's own "Coding objective". Task E02/F01/US02/T02 ("hybrid-ocr") adds the
/// fifth, <see cref="OcrAsync"/> (ADR-017), whose request/result shape is a full-document page map
/// (ADR-017 "Implications for the decomposition": "must persist a page map so evidence
/// source.page / section still resolve") rather than the free-text/JSON shapes the other four
/// roles use — <see cref="OcrAsync"/> is the one role whose entire job is turning raw bytes into
/// text, so it is also the one role whose input is bytes, not a string.
///
/// Every method returns <see cref="Result{T}"/> (this codebase's convention for expected
/// failures — e.g. <c>Contigo.Documents.Contracts.Application.DocumentUploadService</c>) rather
/// than throwing, and every successful result carries an
/// <see cref="Contracts.AiCallMetadata"/> record (model id/version, prompt version, timestamp,
/// input hash) so callers — and task E02/F01/US01/T02's logging — always have brief §8's
/// reproducibility fields available without recomputing them.
