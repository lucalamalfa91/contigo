    /// per-connection `current_setting('app.tenant_id', true)` claim that
    /// <see cref="Contigo.SharedKernel.Tenancy.TenantRlsConnectionInterceptor"/> sets — the same
    /// mechanism task E01/F04/US03/T01 wired up for Documents/Contracts, task E01/F05/US01/T01
    /// wired up for Identity/Workspace, and task E01/F06/US02/T01 wired up for Audit, applied here
    /// to this module's own table. `FORCE` makes the policy apply even to the table owner (the
    /// role migrations/the app run as), not just to ordinary non-owner roles. `WITH CHECK` mirrors
    /// `USING` so a session cannot write a row into a tenant it is not scoped to, not just read
    /// across tenants. `nullif(..., '')` guards the `::uuid` cast: `current_setting(..., true)`
    /// returns NULL when the GUC was never set on this session, but Postgres can also leave a
    /// *pooled* connection's custom GUC as an empty string after `RESET app.tenant_id` rather than
    /// fully undefined — casting `''::uuid` throws, which would turn "no active tenant scope" into
    /// a 500 instead of the intended zero-rows-visible. `nullif` folds both "never set" and "reset
    /// to empty" to SQL NULL first, so the row comparison always safely evaluates to NULL (never
    /// TRUE) instead of erroring.
    ///
    /// The table list is intentionally the fixed set that exists as of this migration (mirrors how
    /// `Initial` hardcodes its own table) — a future tenant-scoped table in this module gets its
    /// own follow-up migration adding RLS for it. What stays generic and catches an omission is the
    /// CI migration check (`Contigo.Renewals.Tests.RenewalActionRlsMigrationCheckTests`), which
