    /// applied to the audit trail itself) a database-enforced guarantee rather than only an
    /// API-shape convention. <see cref="Infrastructure.AuditWriter"/> never exposes an
    /// update/delete method, but that alone only stops a well-behaved caller going through this
    /// module's own port — a future bug (a raw SQL statement, a mistaken `DbSet.Update`/`Remove`
    /// call, a different tool connecting straight to Postgres) could still mutate history. A
    /// `BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE` trigger closes that gap unconditionally: unlike Row-Level
    /// Security's `FORCE` clause (which only changes whether a *policy* applies to the table
    /// owner), a trigger fires for every session that attempts the statement — table owner,
    /// superuser, or ordinary role alike — so this holds regardless of which Postgres role the
    /// application, a migration, or an operator happens to be connected as.

    /// `RAISE EXCEPTION ... USING ERRCODE = 'insufficient_privilege'` gives callers a stable,
    /// documented SQLSTATE (`42501`, surfaced by Npgsql as

    /// <c>Npgsql.PostgresErrorCodes.InsufficientPrivilege</c>) to branch on, rather than only a
    /// free-text message. The function deliberately does not reference `OLD`/`NEW` column values
    /// (only `TG_OP`) so it never has to special-case that `NEW` is unassigned on a `DELETE`
