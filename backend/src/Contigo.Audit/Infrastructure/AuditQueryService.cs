/// every public method opens its own <see cref="ITenantContext.BeginScope"/> for the tenant it was
/// given, rather than trusting a caller to have already entered one. That scope is what lets
/// <see cref="Contigo.SharedKernel.Tenancy.TenantRlsConnectionInterceptor"/> set the `app.tenant_id`
/// claim Postgres RLS enforces against — with no active scope, ADR-009's RLS backstop fails
/// *closed* (zero rows, for every tenant; see
/// <c>Contigo.Audit.Tests.AuditRlsCrossTenantIsolationTests.No_active_tenant_scope_sees_zero_audit_events</c>),
/// which would otherwise make every `GET /api/audit` call return an empty list regardless of caller.
/// The explicit <c>Where(TenantId == tenantId)</c> in <see cref="AuditQueryService"/> is the
