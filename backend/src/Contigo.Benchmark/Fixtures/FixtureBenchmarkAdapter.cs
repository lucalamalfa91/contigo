/// Deterministic, provider-free <see cref="IBenchmarkService"/> implementation — the first
/// Benchmark Service adapter (story us-02-fixture-adapter; task E04/F01/US02/T01, objective:
/// "Fixture adapter returning P25/P50/P75 + confidence + provenance"). ADR-001 fixes this as the
/// *only* adapter for the first `demo`: "R3/R4 benchmark work gated on the interface + fixture
/// adapter, never a paid external API." Product spec §10.2's own Benchmark Service diagram names
/// "Internal Dataset" as one of four Provider Adapter kinds (alongside "Provider A", "Provider B",
/// "Customer History") — this class is that adapter, backed by a hand-curated, in-memory catalog of
/// illustrative SaaS supplier/product comparables. Never a real provider's licensed data, and never a
/// call to Tropic, Vendr, or any paid market API anywhere in this type or its project (AC-2; spec
/// §10.2's "Strategic requirement").
///
/// Matching (spec §10.4: "Matching must use more than supplier name") requires <see
/// cref="BenchmarkQuery.Supplier"/>, <see cref="BenchmarkQuery.Product"/>,
/// <see cref="BenchmarkQuery.Geography"/>, <see cref="BenchmarkQuery.Currency"/>,
/// <see cref="BenchmarkQuery.Term"/>, <see cref="BenchmarkQuery.Quantity"/> (against a fixture's own
/// quantity tier) and <see cref="BenchmarkQuery.PurchaseDate"/> (against a fixture's own refresh
/// date — spec §10.3's stated reason for carrying a purchase date at all: "so comparables can be
/// filtered to a relevant window") as a required baseline — seven of product spec §10.4's eleven
/// named comparison dimensions — plus <see cref="BenchmarkQuery.Sku"/> as an optional,
/// confidence-boosting eighth when both the query and the matched fixture name one. A <see
/// cref="BenchmarkResult.ComparisonDimensions"/> set containing only
/// <see cref="BenchmarkComparisonDimension.Supplier"/> can never come out of this adapter (AC-3).
///
/// When no fixture clears that baseline, this adapter never fabricates a number (ADR-001; spec
/// §10.4's benchmark-trust rule, verbatim: "A precise-looking number from weak comparables is more
/// dangerous than an explicit 'insufficient market data' result"). It reports <see
/// cref="BenchmarkResult.Distribution"/> as <see langword="null"/> instead — falling back to a
/// weaker, supplier+product-only comparable when one exists (so the caller still sees a real metric
/// and sample size, just not a trustworthy distribution), or to no comparison dimensions at all when
/// even that does not exist. Task E04/F01/US02/T02 (fixture-confidence) extends that same abstain
/// path to a comparable that is <i>dimensionally</i> strong (clears every baseline dimension) but
/// still <i>statistically</i> weak — see <see cref="MinimumViableSampleSize"/> — so a thin sample
/// size can never dress itself up as a trustworthy distribution just because it happened to match on
