/// Benchmark Service interface consumed by domain modules (Renewals, Savings, Quotes; ADR-002
/// module-map). Domain modules depend on this abstraction only — the implementation behind it is
/// the sole place that talks to a provider adapter, so business logic can never call a benchmark
/// provider directly (product spec §10.2 "Strategic requirement": "No business module should
/// depend on Tropic, Vendr or any single provider schema"; the Appendix C benchmark rule: "Never
/// call a benchmark provider directly from renewal, savings or quote business logic").

/// Task E04/F01/US01/T01 (this task) defines the normalized contract only: the
/// <see cref="GetBenchmarkAsync"/> signature and its request/response DTOs
/// (<see cref="BenchmarkQuery"/>, <see cref="BenchmarkResult"/>). Task E04/F01/US01/T02 (this
/// story's other task, "adapter registry + provider SDK isolation") adds the pluggable
/// provider-adapter registry behind this interface; story us-02-fixture-adapter adds the first
/// adapter — an internal fixture, never a paid external API for the first `demo` (ADR-001) — that
/// actually performs matching and produces provenance/confidence. Until an adapter is registered,
/// this interface has no implementation or DI registration in the solution — expected for this
/// task's scope (mirrors how <c>Contigo.AiGateway.IAiGateway</c> existed before
/// <c>FixtureAiGateway</c> did).
