/// <c>Contigo.Identity.Workspace.Infrastructure.CreateWorkspaceRequest</c> lives next to

/// <c>Contigo.ArchitectureTests.DependencyDirectionTests.Host_must_not_contain_domain_types</c>
/// only inspects the <c>Contigo.Api</c>/<c>Contigo.Worker</c> assemblies, so a request contract

/// <see cref="Corrections"/> is a field-name/new-value string map rather than one strongly-typed
/// property per <see cref="Domain.Contract"/> field: <see cref="Domain.CorrectionHistory"/> itself
/// stores every correction as a string-valued (<c>PreviousValue</c>/<c>NewValue</c>) diff (see
/// that type's doc comment), so the wire shape mirrors the storage shape exactly — one canonical
/// per-field string parser (<see cref="ContractCorrectionService"/>) instead of two (one for JSON
/// binding, one for the history row). A key absent from the map leaves that field untouched; a key
/// present with a JSON <c>null</c> clears an optional field (rejected for a field that is
/// required — see <see cref="ContractCorrectionService"/>'s field table). Only
/// <see cref="ContractCorrectionService.CorrectableFieldNames"/> are accepted.
