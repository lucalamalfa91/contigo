    /// app's own role. `WITH CHECK` mirrors `USING` so a session cannot write a row into a
    /// tenant it is not scoped to, not just read across tenants. `nullif(..., '')` guards the
    /// `::uuid` cast: `current_setting(..., true)` returns NULL when the GUC was never set on
    /// this session, but Postgres can also leave a *pooled* connection's custom GUC as an empty
    /// string after `RESET app.tenant_id`
    /// (<see cref="Contigo.SharedKernel.Tenancy.TenantRlsConnectionInterceptor"/> resets on
    /// connection return) rather than fully undefined — casting `''::uuid` throws, which would
    /// turn "no active tenant scope" into a 500 instead of the intended zero-rows-visible.
    /// `nullif` folds both "never set" and "reset to empty" to SQL NULL first, so the row
    /// comparison always safely evaluates to NULL (never TRUE) instead of erroring.
