/// <b>Deliberately narrow, not a general date/duration parser</b>: <c>Contigo.Quotes.Domain
/// .QuoteLine.Term</c> is free text with no ADR/spec-fixed vocabulary (see that property's own doc
/// comment), so a numeric commitment length ("36 months", "3 years") is genuinely ambiguous between
/// "this recurs every N months" and "this is a one-time N-month commitment billed some other,
/// unstated way" — this codebase has no way to actually know which, and guessing would be exactly
/// the fabricated conversion Appendix C rule 10 forbids (the same restraint
/// <c>Contigo.Savings.Application.PriceComparisonRequest</c>'s own doc comment documents for
/// cross-module term alignment: "no additional term-arithmetic... when the true billing-period
/// relationship is not actually known"). Only phrases with one, singular, commonly-understood
/// meaning are recognized — for example "biannual"/"biennial" are deliberately <b>not</b> in this
/// vocabulary, because that word alone is genuinely ambiguous in English between "twice a year" and
/// "every two years". Anything not listed here — including every numeric term, "one-time",
/// "perpetual", a blank/whitespace-only term, or free text this method does not recognize — resolves
/// to <see langword="null"/>, the honest "cannot determine" this codebase always prefers over a
/// guess (Appendix C rule 10; spec §11.3 "line-item normalization is unresolved").
