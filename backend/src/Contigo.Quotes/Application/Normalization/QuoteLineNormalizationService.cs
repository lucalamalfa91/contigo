/// today (<c>Contigo.Api.QuoteExtractionPipeline.ProcessAsync</c>) runs this immediately after

/// instance's change tracker, still before the one shared <c>SaveChangesAsync</c> call that persists
/// both extraction and normalization together as a single unit of work — a query against the
/// database would find nothing yet, since those rows do not exist there until that shared save
/// happens. Never calls <c>Contigo.AiGateway</c> or any provider: every input this type reads
/// (<see cref="QuoteLine.UnitPrice"/>, <see cref="QuoteLine.Term"/>) was already extracted and
