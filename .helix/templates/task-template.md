# task-NN-<slug> — <title>

## Coding objective
<Imperative, 3-8 sentences. What to build, in which of the four repos, against
 which contract. Name the real types, endpoints, Terraform modules, SKUs and
 libraries the council decided on — never "a suitable X".>

## Parent story AC covered
- AC-2 <verbatim from the story>
- AC-3 <verbatim>

## Files to create or modify
| Path | Change |
|------|--------|
| workspace/contigo-backend/… | … |

Passata 2 cwd is the per-task worktree (a copy of this artifact). Product code
goes under `workspace/<repo>/`. That folder is not the GitHub remote.

## Context the implementer needs
- **Architecture decisions in force**: ADR-NNN (<the constraint>)
- **Do not touch**: <files or areas out of scope for this task>

## Definition of done
- [ ] <a check that can be RUN: a named test, a command with exit code 0>
- [ ] <another>

Never "the code is clean" — the reviewer runs these boxes.

## Tests required
| Level | What it proves | Where |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| unit | <the behaviour> | <path> |

## Open questions blocking this task
- <OQ-NNN — the question, and the assumption in force> | none
