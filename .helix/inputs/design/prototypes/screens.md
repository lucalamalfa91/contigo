## 1. Sign-in → workspace — R0 (§16 R0, §20 "Create a workspace")
Left: statement panel (accent-100 ground with grid, north-star sentence, 4 V1 jobs). Right: "Continue with Microsoft Entra ID" → redirect state → workspace list (name, contract count, currency/region, role tag) + "Create a new workspace".
States: idle · redirecting (spinner) · workspace picker.

## 2. Members & roles — R0 (§3.1, §20 "invite Procurement users")

## 3. Upload → document status — R0/R1 (§7.1 statuses)
Dropzone (drag-and-drop, "Choose from computer" file picker, sample file), formats/size/sources strip. Processing pipeline list (6 stages, current pulsing). Result card by outcome. Document table: Document / Type / Supplier / Status / Uploaded, rows open Contract 360.
States: idle · uploading/processing · **needs_review** · completed · **failed** (password-protected PDF, retry).

## 4. Portfolio — R1 (§8.1 columns + filters)
Header + filter chips (Supplier, Category, Renewal period, Spend, Status, Risk, Auto-renewal). **Attention strip**: Deadlines < 45 d · Need review · Failed/processing · High risk (click = filter). Table (fixed widths, min 1000px, scrolls): Attention · Supplier · Contract · Annual spend · Start · End · Renewal · Cancel by · Auto · Status. Rows sorted by severity → deadline → score; critical rows tinted + red bar.
States: populated · loading (skeleton) · empty (first upload CTA) · error (503 + retry) · no match for filter.

## 5. Contract 360 — R1 (§8.2 header + 10 tabs)
Header: supplier kicker, contract name, type/status tags, doc count; 6-cell fact row (annual spend, TCV, start→end, renewal + days, cancellation deadline + notice, risk + priority). Tab bar.

- **Commercials / Products / Clauses / Obligations / Risks / Documents / Benchmark / Renewal / Activity**: one template — h6 title + summary line right + `.table` (Term · Value · Source · Confidence pattern). Benchmark adds a P25/P50/P75 ladder; Renewal adds priority-score component table.

## 6. Review / correction — R1 (§7.3 thresholds, §4.1 correction history)
Header + "Mark as validated" (disabled until all < 80% fields decided). Progress line + legend. 4-column list: Field (critical marker) · Extracted value + source · Confidence tag · Decision (Accept / Correct or result).

## 7. Ask Contigo — R1 (§8.3 routing, §8.4 evidence)
Global Ask bar on every screen (contextual suggestions; Enter → this screen; ⌘K). Chat with route line ("Structured query…", "Clause retrieval…"), numbered citation chips (doc · page · §) opening Contract 360 › Clauses. **Abstain** block: "Cannot determine reliably" + reason. Right rail: suggested questions.
States: empty · thinking (authorise → intent → retrieve) · answered · abstain · unknown question fallback.

## 8. Renewal pipeline — R2 (§9.1 thresholds, §9.2 score, §9.3 insight card)
Header + summary. **Threshold strip** 0–30 … 270–365 d with counts (click = filter). Table: Score · Supplier · contract · Annual spend · Renews in · Cancel by · Status. Insight card (§9.3 fields: spend, cancellation deadline, uplift, market position, potential savings, owner; recommended action + rationale) with actions Start negotiation / Assign to me / Snooze → confirmation + link to Contract 360.
