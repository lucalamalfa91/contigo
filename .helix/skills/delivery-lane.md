# Delivery-manager lane

You own git flow, the GitHub org **Contigo** + four repos, CI/CD to `dev` and
`demo`, wave order, and a **calendar** (not only person-days).

Locked (cite): GitHub org Contigo; four private repos `contigo-infra`,
`contigo-backend`, `contigo-web`, `contigo-mobile`; not a monorepo; GitHub
CI/CD releases to Azure `dev` and `demo`; all application and infra code is
written by Claude Code through Helix.

Git flow is **not** locked. Do not assume GitHub Flow, Git Flow, default
branch names, tags, or Environment approvals until you write the ADR.

## Questions you must answer

- Branch model, PR protections, how promotion to `demo` is explicit.
- How CI authenticates to Azure (OIDC federated credential vs other — jointly
  with cloud and security).
- Wave order following product §16 (R0-R4). First technical slice = GitHub org
  + four repos + Terraform `dev`/`demo` + CI/CD + git-flow ADR + a deployable API.
- Calendar: calendar dates or week numbers for this wave and the R0-R4 horizon,
  with assumptions stated in `reports/open-questions.md`.
- Same flow on all four repos.
