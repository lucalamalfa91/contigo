# {fn} — {title}

## Coding objective
{objective}

## Parent story AC covered
- See parent story `{story}` acceptance criteria (traced by this task objective).

## Files to create or modify
| Path | Change |
|------|--------|
| workspace/{repo}/src/ | implementation for `{produces[0]}` |

## Context the implementer needs
- **Architecture decisions in force**: {', '.join(adrs)}.
- **Do not touch**: unrelated wave artifacts and provider SDKs in domain code.

## Definition of done
- [ ] Applicable build (e.g. `dotnet build`) exits 0 and a named test proves the produced artifact `{produces[0]}`.

## Tests required
| Level | What it proves | Where |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| unit | {produces[0]} behaviour | workspace/{repo}/tests |

## Open questions blocking this task
- none

## Wave-spec entry
```yaml
- id: {tid}
  prompt: {info["prompt"]}
  produces: [{prod_list}]
  depends_on: [{dep_list}]
  effort: {effort}
