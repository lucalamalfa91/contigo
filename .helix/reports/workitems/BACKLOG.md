# Contigo V1 — Work-item backlog

Source of truth: `reports/architecture/INDEX.md` (17 accepted ADRs), `reports/context/product-context.md`, `reports/context/locked-decisions.md`, `inputs/product-spec.md`.

Decomposed against the **full** V1 wave ladder R0–R4 (ADR-001, spec §16), not only the R0 foundation slice. Every accepted ADR in INDEX is carried into at least one task objective.

Target: `dev` + `demo` only. No production. R3/R4 use the fixture benchmark adapter, never a paid external market API for the first `demo`.

## Wave overview

| Wave | Epic | Capability | Definition of success (spec §16) |
|------|------|------------|----------------------------------|
| R0 | epic-01 platform | Auth, workspace, multi-tenancy, roles, upload, storage, DB, audit baseline + org/repo/Terraform/CI-CD/deployable API | A secure workspace can ingest documents |
| R1 | epic-02 Contract Intelligence | Extraction including OCR in V1 (ADR-017), schema, portfolio, Contract 360, Q&A, citations, validation | Customer can upload contracts (digital and scanned) and ask reliable questions |
| R2 | epic-03 Renewal Intelligence | Dates, cancellation deadline, alerts, dashboard, priority, recommendations (deterministic) | Procurement does not miss material renewal windows |
| R3 | epic-04 Savings Intelligence | Benchmark service/adapters, price comparison, savings dashboard/workflow | Contigo quantifies credible savings opportunities |
| R4 | epic-05 Quote Check | Quote extraction, benchmark, assessment, target, negotiation strategy | A new proposal can be assessed in minutes |

Each wave ends with a single-task `us-XX-final-integration` story. R4's integration story is the customer Day-1 path on `demo` (spec §20).

## Non-goals (excluded, ADR-001, spec §1.2)

Full CLM/authoring · e-signature · PO/invoice management · supplier onboarding · full sourcing/RFP · ERP replacement · autonomous supplier comms · complex enterprise approval orchestration · production-only platform (AKS/multi-region/dedicated DB).

## Web delta (epic-06+, wave 6+)

The web pass (`layer: web`, `target_repo: contigo-web`) closes the user-visible
ladder that E01–E05 decomposed as backend-only. It treats E01–E05 as done and
adds the browser surface, per ADR-018/019/020 and the Claude Design handoff at
`inputs/design/prototypes/`.

Master web DAG: `reports/plan/wave-spec.web.yaml`. Web slices: `reports/plan/slices/e06.yaml` … (via `python scripts/cut_web_slices.py`). See `reports/plan/slices/INDEX-web.md` and `MANIFEST-web.yaml`.

The last web story is `us-01-final-integration` (E08/F04): a single task walking
spec §20 Day-1 in the browser on `demo`, matching `inputs/design/prototypes/day1-demo.html`.

## Status

Fully decomposed R0–R4. Master DAG: `reports/plan/wave-spec.execution.yaml`. Nightly slices: `reports/plan/slices/`.
Web delta (wave 6+) decomposed. Web DAG: `reports/plan/wave-spec.web.yaml`. Web slices: `reports/plan/slices/e06.yaml` … .
