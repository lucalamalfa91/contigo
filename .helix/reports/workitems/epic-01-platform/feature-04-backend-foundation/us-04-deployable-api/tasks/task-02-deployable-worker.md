## Coding objective
Create the thin worker host consuming the queue and shared app services.

| workspace/contigo-backend/src/ | implementation for `deployable-worker` |

## Context the implementer needs
- **Architecture decisions in force**: ADR-002.
- **Do not touch**: unrelated wave artifacts and provider SDKs in domain code.

## Definition of done

## Tests required
| Level | What it proves | Where |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| unit | deployable-worker behaviour | workspace/contigo-backend/tests |

## Open questions blocking this task
