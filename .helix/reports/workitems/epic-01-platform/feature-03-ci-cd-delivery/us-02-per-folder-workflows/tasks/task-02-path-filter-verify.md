# task-02-path-filter-verify — 02 Path Filter Verify

## Coding objective
Verify four workflows have correct path filters and mobile non-blocking.

## Parent story AC covered
- See parent story `us-02-per-folder-workflows` acceptance criteria (traced by this task objective).

## Files to create or modify
| Path | Change |
|------|--------|
| workspace/contigo-infra/src/ | implementation for `ci-path-filters` |

## Context the implementer needs
- **Architecture decisions in force**: ADR-014.
- **Do not touch**: unrelated wave artifacts and provider SDKs in domain code.

## Definition of done
- [ ] Applicable build (e.g. `dotnet build`) exits 0 and a named test proves the produced artifact `ci-path-filters`.

## Tests required
| Level | What it proves | Where |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| unit | ci-path-filters behaviour | workspace/contigo-infra/tests |

## Open questions blocking this task
- none
