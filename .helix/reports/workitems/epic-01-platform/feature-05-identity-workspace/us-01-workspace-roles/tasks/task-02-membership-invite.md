# task-02-membership-invite — 02 Membership Invite

## Coding objective
Implement workspace invite + role assignment with OIDC claims.

## Parent story AC covered
- See parent story `us-01-workspace-roles` acceptance criteria (traced by this task objective).

## Files to create or modify
| Path | Change |
|------|--------|
| workspace/contigo-backend/src/ | implementation for `workspace-membership` |

## Context the implementer needs
- **Architecture decisions in force**: ADR-010, ADR-009.
- **Do not touch**: unrelated wave artifacts and provider SDKs in domain code.

## Definition of done
- [ ] Applicable build (e.g. `dotnet build`) exits 0 and a named test proves the produced artifact `workspace-membership`.

## Tests required
| Level | What it proves | Where |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| unit | workspace-membership behaviour | workspace/contigo-backend/tests |

## Open questions blocking this task
- none
