# task-01-workspace-members-invite — Members & roles + invite UI

## Coding objective
Implement the members table + invite form with admin/procurement gate.

## Parent story AC covered
- AC-1 (members table), AC-2 (invite pane + roles), AC-3 (non-admin state).

## Files to create or modify
| Path | Change |
|------|--------|
| workspace/contigo-web/src/routes/workspace/members/ | members UI |
| inputs/design/prototypes/ia.md | roles (cite) |
| inputs/design/prototypes/screens.md | screen 2 (read, cite) |
| inputs/design/prototypes/day1-demo.html | reference (cite) |

## Context the implementer needs
- **Claude Design handoff**: `inputs/design/prototypes/screens.md` (2), `day1-demo.html`; prefer `/design-sync`.
- **Architecture decisions in force**: ADR-018 (admin vs procurement gate), ADR-020 (screen 2).

## Definition of done
- [ ] Invite + role gate works in browser; `npm run build` exits 0.

## Tests required
| Level | What it proves | Where |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| unit | non-admin sees request-access, not invite | workspace/contigo-web/tests |
