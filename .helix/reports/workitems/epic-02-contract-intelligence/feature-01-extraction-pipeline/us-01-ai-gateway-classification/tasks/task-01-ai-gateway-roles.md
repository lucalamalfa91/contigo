## Coding objective
Implement IAiGateway classify/extract/embed/answer + config-selected IDs.

## Parent story AC covered

## Context the implementer needs
- **Architecture decisions in force**: ADR-004, ADR-011.
- **Do not touch**: unrelated wave artifacts and provider SDKs in domain code.

## Definition of done
- [ ] Applicable build (e.g. `dotnet build`) exits 0 and a named test proves the produced artifact `ai-gateway-roles`.

## Tests required
| Level | What it proves | Where |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| unit | ai-gateway-roles behaviour | workspace/contigo-backend/tests |

## Open questions blocking this task
