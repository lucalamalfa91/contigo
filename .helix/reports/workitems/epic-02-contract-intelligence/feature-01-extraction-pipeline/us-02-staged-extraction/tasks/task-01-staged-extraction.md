# task-01-staged-extraction — 01 Staged Extraction

## Coding objective
Implement staged schema-constrained extraction with source+confidence.

## Parent story AC covered
- See parent story `us-02-staged-extraction` acceptance criteria (traced by this task objective).

## Files to create or modify
| Path | Change |
|------|--------|
| workspace/contigo-backend/src/ | implementation for `extraction-pipeline` |

## Context the implementer needs
- **Architecture decisions in force**: ADR-004, ADR-002.
- **Do not touch**: unrelated wave artifacts and provider SDKs in domain code.

## Definition of done
- [ ] Applicable build (e.g. `dotnet build`) exits 0 and a named test proves the produced artifact `extraction-pipeline`.

## Tests required
| Level | What it proves | Where |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| unit | extraction-pipeline behaviour | workspace/contigo-backend/tests |

## Open questions blocking this task
- none
