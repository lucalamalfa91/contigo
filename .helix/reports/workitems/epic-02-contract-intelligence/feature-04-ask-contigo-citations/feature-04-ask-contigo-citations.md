# feature-04-ask-contigo-citations — Ask Contigo query router + citations

## Slice

Implement the Ask Contigo query engine: route structured queries to deterministic
SQL, semantic/legal queries to RAG, enforce auth-before-retrieval, and return only
answers with source citations (or an explicit "cannot determine").

## User stories

| ID | Title | Wave |
|----|-------|------|
| us-01 | Structured vs semantic query router | R1 |
| us-02 | RAG retrieval + grounded answer with citations | R1 |

## Architecture decisions in force

- ADR-004 (answer role)
- ADR-011 (auth-before-retrieval, no unauthorized data in context)
- ADR-003 (pgvector retrieval)

## Target repo
