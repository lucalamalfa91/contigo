## Coding objective
Opening target/range/walk-away/levers with rationale.

## Parent story AC covered

| workspace/contigo-backend/src/ | implementation for `negotiation-strategy` |

## Context the implementer needs
- **Architecture decisions in force**: ADR-002, ADR-004.
- **Do not touch**: unrelated wave artifacts and provider SDKs in domain code.

## Definition of done

## Tests required
| Level | What it proves | Where |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| unit | negotiation-strategy behaviour | workspace/contigo-backend/tests |

## Open questions blocking this task
- none
