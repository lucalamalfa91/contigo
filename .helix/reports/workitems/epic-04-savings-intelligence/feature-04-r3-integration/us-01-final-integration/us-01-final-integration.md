## Story

As a **product owner**, I want the R3 definition of success proven end-to-end, so
that "Contigo quantifies credible savings opportunities".

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] AC-1 Matched contracts show current price + P25/P50/P75 + percentile/target/saving/confidence/provenance.
- [ ] AC-2 SavingsOpportunity lifecycle works end-to-end on `demo`.
- [ ] AC-3 No paid benchmark provider is called.

## Definition of done

- [ ] `dotnet test` (integration) runs the R3 path with fixture benchmark; `demo` smoke documented.

## Dependencies

| Depends on | Why |
|------------|-----|
| every R3 leaf artifact | proves the wave |

## Architecture decisions in force

- ADR-001, ADR-002, ADR-003, ADR-009, ADR-016.

## Tasks
