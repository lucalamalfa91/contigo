# ADR-019 — Web design system (tokens, type, colour, components)

- **Status**: accepted
- **Date**: 2026-09-04
- **Deciders**: ux-ui-designer (draft), council-close
- **Locked citations**: "Visual design method: Claude Design is mandatory" (web-integration-brief §2, §5); "ADR-012 is locked — no new frontend-framework ADR unless a defect blocks" (brief §2). Both respected; this ADR adopts, does not re-pick, a stack.

## Context and problem statement

The web pass must deliver the user-visible ladder with a UI that matches the
Claude Design prototype, "not a localhost config.json shell and not a raw
Swagger page" (brief §7). A design system is therefore a decision, not a
backlog garnish: without locked tokens, type, colour, components, and semantic
mappings, the Code implementer will invent a divergent visual language
screen-by-screen and the `demo` result will not match the prototype that
defines §20 success.

The design system has already been authored in Claude Design and exported to
disk under `inputs/design/prototypes/design-system.md` (text dump) and bound in
the interactive prototype `inputs/design/prototypes/day1-demo.html`. This ADR
adopts that export verbatim as the single visual source of truth and states the
implementation rule: consume the exported `styles.css` tokens, do not fork them.

## Decision drivers

- **Visual fidelity to §20** — the acceptance "matches the Claude Design
  prototype" is only checkable if tokens are shared, not re-derived.
- **AI-assisted implementation** — a small Claude Code team needs a small,
  deterministic token set it can consume mechanically (via `/design-sync` where
  enabled, or the markdown dump where not).
- **Accessibility baseline** — contrast, keyboard, empty states are part of the
  seat's ownership (brief §4) and must be encoded in the system, not left to
  per-screen judgement.

## Considered options

1. **Adopt the exported Modernist system verbatim** (chosen).
2. **Adopt values but re-author them as an in-repo JSON/CSS Kit** owned by the
   code repo.
3. **Design a new token set** in prose during council chat.

## Decision outcome

**Chosen: Option 1** — adopt the Claude Design export
(`inputs/design/prototypes/design-system.md`, bound system folder
`_ds/modernist-*`) as the authoritative design system, with
`inputs/design/prototypes/design-system.md` as the text dump and
`inputs/design/prototypes/day1-demo.html` as the executable reference. The
system is architectural/ink-on-ground: flat, 0px corner radius, flush-left
alignment, one accent colour used sparingly.

### Consequences

- **Good**: one authoritative source already on disk; implementer consumes
  tokens rather than inventing them; semantic mappings (confidence → tag, risk →
  colour, abstain → block) are pre-specified so AI answers don't drift.
- **Bad**: the accent colour (`--color-accent-100/200` as critical-row tint and
  sign-in ground) is deliberately opinionated; any stakeholder wanting a
  "friendlier" rounded/card UI will not get it from this system.
- **Neutral**: the system names a specific bound folder inside Claude Design
  (`_ds/modernist-…`); that binding matters only to `/design-sync`, not to the
  static markdown dump.

## Token set (locked)

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| --color-bg | #f3f2f2 | page ground |
| --color-surface | #eae9e9 | panels, inputs, side panes |
| --color-text | #201e1d | ink |
| --color-accent | #ec3013 | primary action, critical marker |
| --color-accent-100/200 | #fff2ef / #ffe0d9 | critical row tint, sign-in ground + grid |
| --color-accent-700 | #ae1800 | accent body text (≥4.5:1) |
| --color-neutral-200…900 | ramp | hovers, selected rows, muted text, stepper |
| --color-divider | ink @ 40% | 2px section rules, 1px row rules |
| --font-heading / --font-body | Archivo | 800 headings, 400/600 body |
| --space-1…8 | 4–32px | spacing scale |
| --shadow-* | tuned | dialogs only (avoid in-app) |

## Type scale (app)

- Screen title `h2` 32px/800; kicker `h6` 13px uppercase, accent (release tag).
- KPI number 26px/800; key-fact number 20–22px/800.
- Table body 13px; table header 11px uppercase letter-spaced.
- Micro meta 11–12px `--color-neutral-600`.

## Component catalogue (locked)

`.btn` (primary/secondary/ghost/block, labels flush-left) · `.tag` (neutral/
accent/outline) · `.table` (2px header, 1px row rules, hover tint) · `.input` ·
`.field > label` · `.radio + .dot` · `.seg` · `.card` (recommendation/provenance
only) · `.hr` (2px) · skeleton bars · attention/threshold strip · detail pane ·
"Facts vs AI" separation. Icons: Lucide, inline SVG, currentColor, 1.5 stroke,
square caps.

## Semantic mapping (locked — drives answer quality, not just colour)

| Meaning | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Confidence > 95% | `.tag-neutral` "Accepted · 97%" |
| Confidence 80–95% | `.tag-accent` "Flagged · 88%" |
| Confidence < 80% | `.tag-outline` "Review · 71%" — blocks consequential use |
| Status completed/Ready | `.tag-neutral` |
| Status needs_review | `.tag-outline` |
| Status failed | `.tag-accent` |
| Risk High | `.tag-accent`; Medium/Low `.tag-neutral` |
| Deadline ≤ 45 d | date in `--color-accent-700`, weight 600 |
| Abstain | 2px accent left rule + `--color-accent-100` block |

These mappings are a **product decision expressed as UI**: they carry the
confidence thresholds from spec §7.3 (>95% accept, 80–95% flag, <80% require
review) directly onto the screen. The decomposer must not treat colour as
decoration — it is the confidence/risk contract rendered.

## Accessibility baseline (locked)

- Contrast: body `#201e1d` on `#f3f2f2` (>12:1); accent-text uses
  `--color-accent-700` `#ae1800` (≥4.5:1) instead of raw `--color-accent`.
- Keyboard: all interactive controls are native (`button`, `input`, `radio`, `a`);
  the Review "Mark as validated" CTA is `disabled` until gating is met, with a
  visible reason, not a hidden control.
- Empty/error copy is plain-language and names the failing job, never a raw stack
  trace (see ADR-018 empty/error/loading).
- No colour-only semantics: every tag/urgency indicator is paired with a text
  label ("Flagged", "High risk", "≤45 d").

## Implications for the decomposition

- New `layer: web` tasks must consume `inputs/design/prototypes/design-system.md`
  and `day1-demo.html`; they must **not** invent a parallel visual language.
- The e06 design-system story ports the token set + component catalogue into
  `web/` as the shared sheet (consuming `styles.css` tokens, not forking values).
- Every screen story cites its prototype file and the semantic mappings above.
- Passata 2 implementer mounts a `claude-design` skill; prefer `/design-sync`
  when the CLI offers it (brief §5.3), else the markdown dump is authoritative.

## Assumptions

- The bound Modernist system folder (`_ds/modernist-…`) is available to the
  Claude Design project referenced in `inputs/design/README.md`; if it is not,
  the `design-system.md` text dump remains the fallback source of truth.
- Claude Code on the implementer path has Design enabled (brief §5.3); otherwise
  the markdown handoff is used and the round-trip is lost. Tracked in
  reports/open-questions.md.
