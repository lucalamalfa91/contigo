# ADR-004 — Foundry model roles and candidate IDs (AI Gateway)

- **Status**: accepted
- **Date**: 2026-09-02
- **Deciders**: software-architect (roles/selection owner) + cloud-architect (IDs/prices in region) jointly; security-architect (RAG isolation) reconciles at council-close
- **Locked citations**: AI — Microsoft Foundry only, via Contigo AI Gateway; domain modules never call a provider directly; use cheapest Foundry models that still meet the tasks (locked-decisions.md). Brief §8: log model/version/prompt/version/timestamp/input-hash; cheapest models for classification, structured extraction, grounded Q&A with citations, embeddings. OCR in V1: ADR-017.

## Context and problem statement

All model I/O flows through the AI Gateway (brief §8). The product needs five distinct *roles*: **ocr** (full-document text/layout; ADR-017), **classification** (document type), **structured extraction** (schema-constrained facts), **embedding** (semantic search/Ask Contigo RAG), and **grounded Q&A** (Ask Contigo with citations). The brief mandates the *cheapest* Foundry / Azure AI surfaces that still perform each role, and forbids customer contract content from training public/shared models. OCR is in V1 (ADR-017); it is not deferred.

The question is which role maps to which model family, and which concrete candidate IDs are preferred such that cost stays minimal and citation/quality is met (or an explicit "cannot determine" is returned).

## Decision drivers

- Cheapest model that meets each role, not one powerful model for everything (brief §8).
- Embeddings must feed pgvector (ADR-data-store) and support auth-before-retrieval RAG (brief §10).
- Extraction must be staged and schema-constrained with source + confidence (brief §7) — a structured-output-capable model (JSON schema) is preferred over free-text parse.
- Grounded Q&A must produce citations or an explicit "cannot determine" (brief §13, done-when #4).

## Considered options

1. **Role-specific split with gateway indirection** — a distinct model ID per role (ocr, classify, extract, embed, answer) behind the AI Gateway's interface, so model selection is a configuration concern and can be swapped without code change.
2. **One flagship model for everything** — a single powerful GPT-4-class model for classify/extract/answer plus a separate embedding model.
3. **No model pinning** — let the gateway ask Foundry for a default; acceptable only for exploration, not the demo.

## Decision outcome

**Chosen: Option 1** — the AI Gateway exposes role interfaces (ocr, classify, extract, embed, answer) and each role is bound to a **configuration-selected model ID**, defaulting to the cheapest model that meets the role, with IDs confirmed at implementation time in the target region by cloud-architect. This is because it satisfies "cheapest per task," keeps model swap a config change (provider locked to Foundry / Azure AI services, but model/version not hard-coded), and makes usage/billing auditable per role (brief §8). OCR is a first-class V1 role (ADR-017), not a later add-on.

### Candidate model IDs (to be confirmed by cloud-architect for price/availability in region)

| Role | Candidate family (Foundry) | Role requirement | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OCR | Azure AI Document Intelligence `prebuilt-read` / `prebuilt-layout` | Full-document text + page map + layout/tables | In V1 (ADR-017). Hybrid: native text when sufficient; OCR/Layout when scanned, image, or table-poor. No 2-page cap. |
| Classify | Small instruction model (e.g. GPT-4o-mini / Phi-class) | Document type from first pages | Cheap; classification is low-complexity. |
| Extract (structured) | Structured-output-capable (e.g. GPT-4o-mini with JSON-schema mode) | Schema-constrained extraction with source spans + confidence | Must support JSON-schema/structured output, not free text (brief §7). |
| Embed | Foundry embedding model (e.g. `text-embedding-3-small` or `text-embedding-3-large` if needed) | Vectors for pgvector RAG | Dimension fixed at schema time; small dimension preferred for cost/size. |
| Answer (grounded Q&A) | Same instruction model as extract, or one tier up if citation quality is insufficient | Grounded answer with citations or "cannot determine" | Must be promptable to cite source and abstain rather than fabricate (Appendix C rule 10). |

Exact IDs and per-1k-token prices are **cloud-architect's** lane: they must confirm the identifier and price in the target region at implementation time and record it in their Azure SKU ADR. The software-architect fixes the *roles and selection rule*, not the dollar figure.

### Consequences

- **Good**: Cost scales to the cheapest model per role; no single expensive model monopolizes the bill; model swap is config-only, so the gateway is testable with a fixture model too; per-role usage logging satisfies brief §8 reproducibility.
- **Bad**: Five role bindings to maintain and confirm in region; a per-role model that underperforms (e.g. structured extraction) may force a one-tier upgrade, which is a config change but still a change; embedding dimension choice must be consistent into pgvector; OCR adds a pay-per-page line (ADR-017).
- **Neutral**: OCR vs native parse is closed by ADR-017 (hybrid, in V1, behind the gateway). Classification may still use "first pages" for type detection; OCR/extract must not.

## Pros and cons of the options

### Option 1 — role-specific split, gateway config
- Good: cheapest-per-role; swappable; auditable per role; keeps provider locked to Foundry.
- Bad: more bindings to confirm; gateway must expose per-role config, not one model knob.

### Option 2 — one flagship for all
- Good: one model to configure.
- Bad: pays flagship price for trivial classification/embedding; violates "cheapest per task"; harder to attribute cost per role.

### Option 3 — no pinning
- Good: zero config effort.
- Bad: non-deterministic cost/behavior; violates reproducibility (brief §8); unacceptable for `demo`.

## Implications for the decomposition

The AI Gateway MUST expose role-based interfaces (ocr, classify, extract, embed, answer) bound through configuration, never a hard-coded model ID in domain code. Every AI call MUST log model ID, version, prompt version, timestamp, and input hash (brief §8); OCR calls MUST also log page count (ADR-017). Structured extraction MUST return schema-constrained output with source spans and confidence; grounded Q&A MUST return citations or an explicit "cannot determine." Embedding dimension MUST be fixed and consistent with the pgvector column definition (coordinate with ADR-data-store). Model IDs/prices MUST be confirmed in the target region before the `demo` wiring task is accepted; until then a fixture gateway adapter satisfies R0 scaffolding. R1 extraction on `demo` MUST exercise the real OCR path for at least one scanned/image fixture (ADR-017).

## Assumptions

- The cheapest structured-output model is sufficient for contract commercial terms; if not, a one-tier upgrade is a config change only.
- OCR is in V1: hybrid native-text + Document Intelligence behind the gateway (ADR-017). Native parse is not assumed sufficient for scanned MSAs.
- Exact model IDs and prices (including Document Intelligence per-page) are filled by cloud-architect in the target region; candidate names above are placeholders, not final selections.
