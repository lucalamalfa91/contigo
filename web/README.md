# Contigo web client

React + TypeScript + Vite SPA. OIDC Authorization Code + PKCE via MSAL, config
injected at runtime. Honours ADR-012 (web stack) and ADR-010 (Entra ID / OIDC).

## Stack

- **React 19 + TypeScript + Vite** — static bundle, no server runtime
  (ADR-012). Build output is `dist/`.
- **`@azure/msal-browser` + `@azure/msal-react`** — Authorization Code + PKCE
  against Entra ID. `PublicClientApplication` has no client-secret field: this
  is structural, not just convention (AC-1).
- **Generated OpenAPI client** (`src/api/`) — the only way `src/` talks to the
  backend API; see "API client" below (AC-3).
- **Vitest + Testing Library** — unit tests under `tests/`, mirroring `src/`.

## Commands

```bash
npm ci                    # install (CI uses this)
npm run dev               # Vite dev server on :5173, reads public/config.json
npm run generate:api      # regenerate src/api/generated/schema.ts from openapi/contigo-api.v1.json
npm run build             # generate:api, then tsc --noEmit type-check, then vite build -> dist/
npm test                  # vitest run (single pass, CI mode)
npm run preview           # serve dist/ locally
```

## Runtime config injection (ADR-012 "config, not code")

The SPA never hard-codes the API origin, OIDC authority, or client id. At
boot (`src/main.tsx`), it fetches same-origin `/config.json` and validates it
(`src/config/appConfig.ts`) before constructing MSAL or rendering the app; a
missing or malformed config fails loudly (a full-page error), never silently
falls back to a guessed value.

This is required by how the CI pipeline is already shaped, not just by
preference: `.github/workflows/web.yml`'s `build` job runs `npm run build`
**once** and uploads a single `web-dist` artifact; the `deploy` job downloads
that same artifact for either `dev` (push to `main`) or `demo` (`workflow_call`
reuse, ADR-016). One compiled bundle is deployed unchanged to both
environments, so per-environment values cannot be baked in at build time
(e.g. Vite `import.meta.env.VITE_*` statics) — they must be resolved from the
deployed origin at request time. `config.json` being a plain static asset
(not part of the JS bundle) is what makes it independently overwritable per
environment after the shared build.

`public/config.json` in this repo is a **local-dev-only placeholder** with
safe, non-secret values (`https://localhost:7109` — the API's dev
`launchSettings.json` port — and `REPLACE_WITH_*` OIDC placeholders). None of
the three config values are secret by design: `client_id` and the redirect
URI are public for a PKCE public client (ADR-010); the API base URL is not
sensitive.

### Known gap: per-environment config injection in CI

`web.yml`'s `deploy` job does not yet overwrite `config.json` in the
downloaded `web-dist/` artifact with that environment's real values before
the Static Web Apps deploy step. Until that lands, a real `dev`/`demo`
deploy of this bundle would serve the checked-in localhost placeholder.
Closing this is CI work: after `download-artifact`, write real
`apiBaseUrl` / `oidcAuthority` / `oidcClientId` / `oidcRedirectUri` /
`oidcApiScopes` (all non-secret) into `web-dist/config.json` before
`swa-cli deploy`. `oidcRedirectUri` should match the SWA origin
(`https://<default_host_name>`), which Terraform already registers on the
public client.

The Static Web App itself is `swa-contigo-<env>` in `rg-contigo-<env>`
(`infra/modules/staticwebapp`). `web.yml` composes that name; it does not
read a GitHub Environment variable. Deploy will 404 the resource until the
HCP VCS apply that creates it has finished — re-run the web workflow after
that apply is CURRENT.

## API client (ADR-012 "one generated TypeScript client, no hand-written divergent DTOs")

Task E01/F07/US01/T02 ("Generate TS API client from OpenAPI; wire /health"):

- `openapi/contigo-api.v1.json` is the single OpenAPI document this client is
  generated from (AC-3). It documents exactly the routes
  `backend/src/Contigo.Api/Program.cs` implements today -- currently just
  `GET /health` -- cross-checked against `backend/tests/Contigo.Api.Tests`.
  **Interim provenance**: the API host does not yet self-publish this document
  (no `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi`/Swashbuckle/NSwag wired into
  `Program.cs`, and adding that is backend work outside this task's
  `target_repo: contigo-web` scope). This file must grow endpoint-by-endpoint
  as the backend does, and be replaced outright once the API self-publishes
  its own document. It also does **not** apply a `/v1`-style URL prefix:
  OQ-client-007 (`reports/open-questions.md`) leaves that choice open, and
  `Program.cs` itself serves bare `/health`, not `/v1/health` -- a client
  generated against a path the API does not actually serve would 404 in every
  real environment.
- `npm run generate:api` (`scripts/generate-api-client.mjs`) reads that
  document and writes `src/api/generated/schema.ts` (`paths`/`operations`
  TypeScript types -- committed, but marked auto-generated/do-not-edit).
  `npm run build` runs it first, so the committed output can never silently
  drift from the contract.
  **Codegen tool choice** (also part of OQ-client-007): the mainstream
  option, `openapi-typescript@7.13.0`, peer-depends on `typescript@^5.x`,
  which hard-conflicts under npm's default strict peer resolution with this
  repo's already-committed `typescript@^7.0.2` (`package.json`, task
  E01/F07/US01/T01) -- verified by running
  `npm install --save-dev openapi-typescript`, which fails with `ERESOLVE`.
  Rather than force an incorrect peer resolution (`--legacy-peer-deps`) or
  downgrade a previous task's already-committed TypeScript version, this repo
  uses a small first-party generator with zero dependencies of its own. It
  emits the same `paths`/`operations` shape the mainstream tools use, so
  swapping to one later (once it supports TypeScript 7) only means deleting
  `scripts/generate-api-client.mjs` -- `src/api/client.ts` does not change.
- `src/api/client.ts` is the hand-written (thin) transport layer on top of
  those generated types -- `createApiClient(baseUrl).getHealth()` -- the same
  division of labour `src/config/appConfig.ts` uses (generated/validated
  shape, hand-written `fetch` plumbing). It deliberately never throws on a
  non-2xx response (an "Unhealthy" 503 is a valid probe answer, not a client
  error) or on a network failure (resolves with `statusCode: null` instead),
  so `src/App.tsx` can render the result directly.
- `src/App.tsx` calls `getHealth()` on mount and renders the result
  (`data-testid="api-health-status"`) independent of sign-in state -- the
  "wire /health" half of this task, and this static SPA's equivalent of the
  parent story's Definition of Done ("`curl` on `/health` via the API client
  succeeds": every load of the deployed bundle performs that check).
